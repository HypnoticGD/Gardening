# Gardening

:wave:  Hey Everyone!
I’m excited to present to you a simple Gardening Script (Mowing Job) at the golf club.

In this script, you get to drive a mower around the golf course, cutting grass and earning money as you go!

Features:

- Get paid per collected marker as you mow.
- Easily add as many checkpoints as you want through config.lua.
- Change the vehicle players use for the job in config.lua.
- Adjust how much players get paid per marker in config.lua.
- Add multiple mower spawn locations via config.lua to suit your needs.
- Customize the start and end job locations easily in config.lua.

Script is for QB-Core
